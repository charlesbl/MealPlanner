TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.
“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

for making modifications to it.

2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives
a license from the original licensors.

11. Patents.
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed that contradict this License, they do not
excuse you from compliance.

A work may be combined with the AGPL-covered work.

local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver.
